A digitally illustrated, painterly portrait of Merzhin, a young, slightly chaotic wizard from the School of Divination in a fantasy world inspired by Arthurian legend and Discworld. He is dressed in layered, oversized red-toned robes—worn and fraying at the edges—with embroidered astrological symbols and a drooping, too-large pointed hat adorned with a shooting star and tea stains. His robe includes visible threadwork and faded magical runes stitched in crooked patterns.

Merzhin is depicted holding his long, wooden staff, which appears plain but subtly emits a faint octarine glow (the color of magic: purplish sparkles), with his fingers resting as if he's listening to it. In the other hand, he holds his spellbook—a chaotic, scrapbook-like tome bound in false dragon-hide, visibly bursting with disorganized pages, inkblots, sketches, and footnotes. The book glows faintly with unpredictable magic and may be shifting in size or shape subtly, implying its unstable enchantment.

Merzhin stands in a 3/4 view, mid-to-full body frame, with a faintly asymmetrical composition. One side glows subtly with floating octarine magical glyphs that spiral in divinatory patterns. His short crossbow is slightly hidden beneath the robe at his hip.

His expression is wide-eyed, pale and unfocused—someone who sees both past and future simultaneously. His pale eyes sparkle with strange intelligence and bemused curiosity, as if answering a question you haven’t asked yet. He has a dry half-smile, like he just muttered a pun only fate would find funny. His posture is off-balance, like he just tripped over something only he could foresee. Include painterly shading, expressive facial details, and wind-tossed hair.

Background is a dark, smoky vignette with faint hints of stars, swirling magical haze, and suggestive details: the silhouette of a library, floating teacups, animated socks, and possibly Death peeking discreetly from a shadow. Lighting should be natural but dramatic—edge-lighting emphasizing the glowing symbols, magical book, and the subtle shimmer on his staff.

Style specs:

* Clean contour lines; soft, textured brushwork especially on fabrics and magical elements.
* Muted earthy palette with dusty reds, greys, purples, and subtle magical highlights (octarine, blue, gold).
* Emphasize painterly realism with light caricature—slightly exaggerated expressions, mystical aura, and Discworld-style visual irony.
* Include whimsical visual easter eggs, such as the sock labeled “For Temporal Emergencies” falling from his satchel, and a spellbook page rearranging itself mid-air.
