**Merzhin, prodigy of dubious coincidences and catalyst of strangely predictable accidents**

**Race**: Human
**Class**: Wizard (School of Divination)
**Level**: 1
**Origin**: Criminal (more watchful by obligation than dishonest, often accused of being in the wrong place at the wrong time)
**Alignment**: Chaotic Good (and a terrible sprinter)

**Backstory**:
Merzhin is the eighth son of an eighth son of an eighth son, which—by the laws of narrative inevitability—makes him special.
Not in the “look at his lovely curls” way, but in the “the universe gave him a glowing birthmark shaped like an ellipsis” kind of way.
His mother was a sharp-tongued herbalist who loved to chat with plants.
Mages, naturally attuned to magic and apt to study it, are the eighth sons of eighth sons.
They are drawn to universities like the UU (Unseen University), where they build careers out of tradition but also because it’s what the multiverse figured was the best way to stop them from procreating—thus avoiding the rise of a source (the eighth son of a mage, squared, which could be either a blessing or a probable cataclysm for the multiverse and everything in it).
Every thousand years, according to fuzzy oral tradition, one mage might lose their way and skip these traditions.
One of those mages is Merzhin’s father—a failed wizard and a traveling accordionist only slightly better at his music—who always disappeared when tax season approached.
As for his other father? Well, local rumor has it that his mother was sometimes heard dancing and singing to demonic music when the father was away (music with howls and rocks in it).

From the moment he could walk, Merzhin could also trip over nothing and explain why.
He spoke in riddles, conversed with birds, and sometimes predicted the weather with alarming precision.
Naturally, this led him to join small, local schools of magic.
Unfortunately, as the magical equivalent of a loaded die, Merzhin began to manifest powerful yet random abilities, earning him impossible relationship failures with other mages, who prized tradition over talent.
After the incident with the faculty tea set and the sudden appearance of a future version of himself declaring, “This was a mistake!”, he foresaw his own expulsion and decided not to give time the chance to prove it.
Taking the initiative, Merzhin set out to live his own adventure.

**Appearance**:
Young Merzhin wears layered red-toned robes, far too large for him, as if they belonged to a future version of himself.
His pointed earth-red hat, also a bit too large, droops on his head under the weight of a few large embroidered astrological symbols and shooting stars.
His eyes are wide open, pale, slightly shadowed, and carry the absent gaze of someone who can see both ends of a conversation at once.
Yet, you can’t miss the spark of deep (and free) intelligence in his eyes.

**Equipment**:
He carries a long staff that looks like a simple stick of wood but vibrates with a faint octarine glow (the color of magic, with purplish sparkles).
A small crossbow always hangs at his hip, partially hidden by his robes.
Magic, he says when he’s serious, doesn’t solve all your problems.
His spellbook is less a book and more a magical notebook bound in a cover that, according to Merzhin, used to be part of a dragon (even if the scales smell more like old library glue).
It’s a chaotic patchwork of inkblots, marginalia, sketches of what he calls “probable futures,” and footnotes that argue with each other.
The pages sometimes rearrange themselves depending on the moon phase or whether he had his tea on the right foot that morning.
Titled “A Modestly Predictable Guide to Improbable Incantations,” this tome is already suspected by the close circle of L-space librarians to contain spells that haven’t been invented yet, notes from alternative versions of Merzhin, and at least one recipe for mushroom soup (which he swears is magical).
He keeps it tucked into a satchel that might be slightly bigger on the inside, alongside a bundle of half-burnt prophecy scrolls and a spare pair of socks labeled “for temporal emergencies.”

**Personality**:
Merzhin is kind, but in the way a riddle is kind—you only understand what he’s doing when it’s too late.
He is obsessed with causality, fate, free will, and whether cats secretly run the universe or just enjoy laughing with Death.
He has dry wit, a tendency to bend the rules with footnotes, and a fondness for tea that tastes like old books or forgotten libraries.
He can’t stay too long away from libraries without feeling dizzy and already knows some of the secrets of L-space, that time-bending nexus between all magical libraries. That’s where he keeps his backup spellbook.

**Motivations**:

* Discover the limits of destiny (and possibly push them off a cliff).
* Understand why he exists and what the universe wants from him (if anything).
* Prove that powerful wizards can also be helpful, humble, and relatively harmless.

**Divination Quirks**:

* Often mutters ominous things like “not that spoon…” before ordering breakfast.
* Frequently answers questions you haven’t asked yet.
* Sometimes seems to be listening to something only he can hear—probably your future complaints.
