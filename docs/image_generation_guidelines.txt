**IMAGE GENERATION GUIDELINES — MERZHIN WIZARD UNIVERSE STYLE**

---

**1. DRAWING STYLE**

* **Medium**: Digital illustration with painterly rendering. Mix of traditional feel and digital texture.
* **Lineart**: Fine, clean ink-style lines; contour lines used selectively. Where fitting, include soft outlines with sketch-like warmth.
* **Brushwork**: Soft round brushes for shading; textured brushwork for fabric and magical artifacts. Detailed, classical-style rendering for key elements (faces, magical items).
* **Detail**: High-resolution texture emphasis—creases in robes, visible threads, magical auras subtly inscribed with runes.
* **Humor**: Embed visual whimsy or irony—odd labels, misplaced magical effects, and slightly exaggerated expressions.

**2. COLOR PALETTE AND SHADING**

* **General Palette**: Muted, desaturated tones with earthy hues; occasional rich highlights.
* **Robes**: Dusty blues, olive greens, greys, browns, and faded reds. Well-worn, layered look with fabric wear.
* **Skin**: Realistic tones with painterly shading and expressive detail—wrinkles, smile lines, and mystical glow.
* **Backgrounds**: Dark, painterly textures with smoky or magical haze.
* **Accent Colors**: Magical effects and runes glow subtly—gold, blue, purple sparkles.
* **Lighting**: Strong but natural light sources; dramatic edge lighting when highlighting magic.

**3. CHARACTER DESIGN (FOCUS ON WIZARDS)**

* **Anatomy**: Stylized realism; slightly elongated with expressive posture, slightly caricatural characters that emphasize tone and personality.
* **Pose**: Static or mildly dynamic; usually frontal or 3/4 view with narrative subtext (e.g., reacting to unseen chaos).
* **Clothing**: Layered robes, oversized or too-long hems, and embroidered symbols.
* **Hat**: Drooping pointed hats, often bent or ornamented (stars, astrological signs, tea stains).
* **Accessories**: Old, overused magical items—staffs, scrolls, glowing trinkets, familiars with attitude.
* **Facial Features**: Realistic with painterly depth—expressive eyes, beards with character, wind-tousled hair.
* **Expression**: Quirky, alert, occasionally bemused. Suggest internal monologue or dry commentary.

**4. COMPOSITION AND FRAMING**

* **Framing**: Mid-to-full body, centered composition with suggestive asymmetry (e.g., spell effect glowing on one side).
* **Backgrounds**: Abstract or vignette-style backdrops, occasionally mimicking book covers or parodying famous artworks.
* **Effects**: Magical glow, floating glyphs, light distortions. Hints of unseen forces at play.
* **Easter Eggs**: Include visual in-jokes or elements that reward close viewing (e.g., animated socks, lurking Death, suspiciously sentient spellbook).

---

**5. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

* **Resolution**: Portrait orientation; minimum 384x512 px.
* **File Type**: RGB JPEG preferred.
* **Style**: Maintain painterly texture and muted tone throughout. High detail with narrative embedded in visuals.
* **Humor Elements**: Subtle parody, caricature touches, whimsical contradictions consistent with the Discworld tone.
