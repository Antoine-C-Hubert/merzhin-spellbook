## üé® **MERZHIN ‚Äî OFFICIAL VISUAL STYLE & DESIGN MANUAL**

---

## **1. Core Physical Attributes**

**Face:**

* **Age:** Young adult, late teens to early twenties ‚Äî a wizard prodigy, not yet wizened.
* **Skin:** Pale, realistic skin tone with painterly shading; faint shadows hinting at insomnia or clairvoyant strain.
* **Eyes:** Wide open, pale irises with subtle sparkles or faint reflections of magical glyphs. They should feel glassy and slightly unfocused ‚Äî seeing past, present, and future at once.
* **Expression:** Dry half-smile bordering on sarcastic; bemused, like he‚Äôs halfway through a pun only he and fate find funny.
* **Hair:** Medium-length, unkempt, wind-tossed. Dark brown to auburn, with a chaotic fringe that breaks the contour of his hat.

---

## **2. Signature Clothing**

**Hat:**

* Oversized, floppy, pointed wizard hat that folds or droops under its own weight.
* Embroidered with astrological symbols and a prominent shooting star.
* Should include visible tea stains ‚Äî a quirky nod to domestic wizarding mishaps.
* Color: Earthy red or faded crimson with aged cloth texture.

**Robes:**

* Layered, oversized, and too large ‚Äî as if borrowed from a future self.
* Main hue: Muted, dusty reds with hints of faded browns, olive greens, and greys in the underlayers.
* Embroidery: Crooked, mismatched runes and astrological symbols stitched in visible threads ‚Äî imperfections are key.
* Hems and edges: Frayed and worn, with visible fabric grain in high-resolution rendering.

**Undershirt / Layers:**

* Subtle glimpses of olive green or greyish garments beneath the robe layers. Muted and understated.

---

## **3. Iconic Items & Props**

**Staff:**

* Long, raw-looking wooden staff. Plain and unpolished in shape.
* Magical effect: Subtle octarine shimmer (the color of magic ‚Äî a purplish sparkle) near the tip or runes faintly visible.
* He often holds it as if listening to it or forgets to lean on it.

**Spellbook:**

* Scrapbook-style, chaotic tome bound in faux dragon-hide that actually resembles cracked library glue with scaly texture.
* Pages should be sticking out, flipping mid-air, and glowing faintly with magical glyphs.
* The book subtly shifts shape or size ‚Äî hints of instability are welcome.
* Title (optional Easter egg): *‚ÄúA Modestly Predictable Guide to Improbable Incantations.‚Äù*
* Should look alive ‚Äî marginalia and footnotes might argue visually.

**Crossbow:**

* Small, simple short crossbow discreetly strapped to his hip, mostly hidden under his robe folds.

**Satchel:**

* Worn leather or cloth satchel, slightly bigger on the inside. Should hint at hidden chaos: scroll ends, loose socks, parchment corners poking out.
* Include the famous sock labeled *‚ÄúFor Temporal Emergencies.‚Äù*

---

## **4. Posing & Body Language**

* **Pose:** 3/4 view or frontal; mid-to-full body framing preferred.
* **Stance:** Slightly off-balance ‚Äî as if he just tripped through a half-foreseen mishap.
* **Gestures:** One hand resting or listening to his staff; the other handling his spellbook, or brushing aside floating glyphs.
* **Expression & Posture:** Mildly startled yet amused; looks caught mid-foretelling.

---

## **5. Magical & Environmental Effects**

**Magic Aura:**

* Floating octarine glyphs spiral near his staff, spellbook, or around his head in divinatory patterns.
* Subtle magical glow: accent colors in octarine, faint gold, or sky blue highlights.

**Background:**

* Painterly smoky vignette.
* Optional Easter Eggs:

  * Silhouette of a cluttered library.
  * Floating teacups.
  * Animated socks drifting.
  * Shadowy glimpse of Death lurking subtly behind a shelf.
  * A spellbook page rearranging itself mid-air.

---

## **6. Artistic Style & Technical Specs**

* **Lineart:** Clean contour lines, soft sketch warmth where fitting.
* **Brushwork:** Painterly, textured brush for fabric folds and magical glow.
* **Color Palette:** Muted, earthy reds, faded purples, greys, and browns; magical accents in octarine, gold, and blue.
* **Lighting:** Strong natural source with dramatic edge lighting emphasizing magical elements.
* **Resolution:** High detail with visible texture ‚Äî creases in robes, loose threads, and layered shading.

---

## **7. Humor & Visual Irony**

* Maintain subtle Discworld-inspired parody:

  * Slight exaggeration in posture and expression.
  * Unexpected labels (e.g., sock ‚ÄúFor Temporal Emergencies‚Äù).
  * Minor chaotic elements: animated inkblots, arguing footnotes, or hidden jokes.
