**Merzhin – Recognizable Character Design Blueprint**

**Face & Expression**

- **Facial Features**: Young and pale with expressive, slightly gaunt features. Prominent, wide-open eyes with a glassy, almost unfocused look — suggesting he sees more than just the present.
- **Eyes**: Pale irises with subtle sparkles or reflections of magical glyphs. Often portrayed mid-glint, conveying bemused foresight.
- **Expression**: Dry half-smile, on the edge of sarcasm or prophetic irony. He looks like he just finished a joke only he and the universe understood.
- **Hair**: Wind-tossed, medium-length and somewhat messy. Typically dark brown or auburn, with a wild, unkempt fringe.

**Hat**

- **Shape & Style**: Oversized, floppy, pointed wizard hat. Slouches or folds under its own weight.
- **Details**: Embroidered with astrological symbols and a shooting star. Often has visible tea stains, making it both magical and domestic.
- **Color**: Earthy red tones, fading toward brown; aged cloth texture.

**Clothing**

- **Robes**: Oversized, layered, red-toned robes that appear secondhand or inherited from a future version of himself.
  - **Condition**: Worn and frayed at the hems; visibly aged fabric.
  - **Detailing**: Embroidered runes and symbols, often stitched at odd angles or with mismatched threads.
  - **Undershirt or layer hints**: Olive green or greyish hints peeking through, muted tones.
- **Accessories**:
  - A short crossbow is always visible near his waist, semi-hidden under robes.
  - Magical trinkets may dangle discreetly from robes (optional but flavorful).

**Staff**

- **Appearance**: Long, unpolished wooden staff — humble in form but faintly glowing.
- **Magical Effect**: Subtle octarine shimmer (purplish-sparkly) around it, not overly flashy.
- **Pose**: Often holding it as if listening to it or using it as a walking stick he forgets to lean on.

**Spellbook**

- **Design**: Scrapbook-style tome with erratically organized pages — some sticking out, flipping, or glowing independently.
- **Cover**: Bound in fake dragon-hide (more like leathery library glue with scales).
- **Aura**: Faint glow, shape-shifting subtly, includes visible sketches, glyphs, and footnotes mid-argument.

**Posture & Pose**

- **Stance**: 3/4 view, slightly off-balance — like he just stumbled sideways through a premonition.
- **Gestures**: One hand on the staff, the other interacting with spellbook or flicking away floating glyphs.
- **Body Language**: Caught mid-thought or mid-prediction, mildly startled but internally amused.

**Style Notes**

- **Color Palette**: Muted earthy reds, faded purples, browns, greys. Magical effects highlighted subtly in octarine, gold, or sky blue.
- **Brushwork & Rendering**: Painterly texture with clean lines; detailed facial rendering. Visible fabric grain and light on folds.
- **Lighting**: Dramatic edge lighting (especially for magical effects); natural light source from above or side.

**Background Elements (Optional but Iconic)**

- Smoky vignette with:

  - Silhouette of a library,
  - Floating teacups,
  - Swirling divination glyphs,
  - Possibly Death lurking subtly,
  - One spellbook page caught mid-air,
